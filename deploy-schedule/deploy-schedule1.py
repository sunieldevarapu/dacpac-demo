Run the Script Normally
This will test the default hardcoded values for both assigned and unassigned tasks.

python deployment_scheduler.py


You should see output like:

PROCESS STARTED 2025-05-16 04:00 CST
ENVIRONMENT: development
Unassigning tasks assigned to AUTOOCTOPUS...
Unassigned task: CTASK003 - Deploy to staging
Unassigned task: CTASK004 - Deploy to production
UNASSIGN 2025-05-16 04:00 CST
--------------------
...
ðŸ§ª 3. Test with No Unassigned Tasks
To simulate a scenario where there are no unassigned tasks, modify the unassigned_tasks list in the script:
unassigned_tasks = []

Then rerun:
python deployment_scheduler.py

You should see that the scheduling step is skipped:

Getting unassigned tasks...
GET TASKS 2025-05-16 04:05 CST
--------------------
(no scheduling output)
ðŸ§ª 4. Test with No Assigned Tasks
To simulate a scenario where there are no assigned tasks, modify the assigned_tasks list:
assigned_tasks = []


Then rerun:

python deployment_scheduler.py


Youâ€™ll see that the unassign and authorize steps donâ€™t process any tasks:

Unassigning tasks assigned to AUTOOCTOPUS...
UNASSIGN 2025-05-16 04:10 CST
--------------------
...
Getting assigned tasks...
GET ASSIGNED TASKS 2025-05-16 04:10 CST
--------------------
Authorizing deployments...
(no deployments authorized)
